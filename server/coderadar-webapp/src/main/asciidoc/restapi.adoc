= Introduction

The coderadar server is a tool for continuous source code analysis. To start analysis of your project,
you only have to provide a few configuration parameters and let coderadar do the work. This document
describes the REST API of the coderadar server.

== Usage of HTTP Verbs

The following table describes how the coderadar API interprets the HTTP verbs.

.HTTP Verbs
|===
|HTTP Verb | Usage

|GET
|GET is used to retrieve information.

|POST
|POST is used to create and update resources.

|DELETE
|DELETE is used to delete resources.

|PUT
|PUT is not used at this time.

|PATCH
|PATCH is not used at this time.
|===

[NOTE]
====
.Usage of GET
If a GET request requires parameters, they can usually be
provided as parameters encoded in the URL. However, in some cases parameters are too unwieldy to
encode them in the URL. In these cases the parameters are expected as JSON string within the request
body. Since some tools don't allow GET requests with a body, coderadar accepts the POST method in
these cases as well.
====

== Error Handling

=== Successful Requests

Successful requests return a response with HTTP status 200 (OK) or 201 (CREATED) and contain a JSON structure in the response
body if applicable.

=== Validation Errors

POST requests against the coderadar API usually expect a JSON structure in the request body. If the JSON structure
contains values that are invalid, the API returns a response with HTTP status 400 (bad request) that contains
an error JSON structure object that looks like this:

include::{snippets}/projects/create/error400/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/create/error400/response-fields.adoc[]

=== General Errors

If some unexpected error occurs during the processing of a request, the API returns a response with HTTP status 500
(internal server error).

= Configuring a Project

This section describes the resources you can interact with to configure a project to be analyzed by coderadar.

== Project

A project defines some metadata about the project you want coderadar to analyze. With a project resource
and its sub-resources you provide coderadar with the information it needs to analyze the source code.

== File Patterns

A file pattern describes a set of files within a project's code base. Each project can have several file patterns
defined. Each file pattern belongs to a certain file set, the most important of which is the SOURCE file set that
is supposed to contain all source code files of your project.

File patterns may either define a pattern for files to be INCLUDED or files to be EXCLUDED. To compile the list of files
contained in a certain file set (like the SOURCE file set), coderadar will first apply all INCLUDE patterns of that file set and then apply all EXCLUDE
patterns. Thus, the file set will include all INCLUDED files except those that were part of an EXCLUDE pattern.

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/filepatterns/get/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/filepatterns/get/http-response.adoc[]

=== Setting a Project's File Patterns

Coderadar views a project's list of file patterns as a single resource. Hence, you can only list and save
all file patterns of a project at once.

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/filepatterns/create-update/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/filepatterns/create-update/http-response.adoc[]

== Analyzer Configuration

Coderadar has a plugin system for source code analyzers so you can implement your own analyzers that produce the metrics
you need (or you can use the analyzer plugins that are shipped with coderadar). For each project, you can configure each analyzer
plugin via the AnalyzerConfiguration resource.

=== Loading a single Analyzer Configuration

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfiguration/getSingle/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfiguration/getSingle/http-response.adoc[]

== Analyzer Configuration File

An AnalyzerConfiguration can be supplied with a configuration file. For example, the Checkstyle analyzer
can be supplied with a checkstyle configuration xml file to define which rules to check. The content of
the configuration file can be text, xml, or even a binary format, depending on the configuration format
the analyzer needs.

=== Uploading an Analyzer Configuration File

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfigurationFile/upload/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfigurationFile/upload/http-response.adoc[]


=== Downloading an Analyzer Configuration File

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfigurationFile/download/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfigurationFile/download/http-response.adoc[]

== Analyzing Strategy

An Analyzing Strategy defines which commits of a project are to be analyzed. If there is no active
Analyzing Strategy present for a project, no analysis will be performed at all. Once you provide
an Analyzing Strategy, analysis jobs will be queued automatically for the commits defined within the strategy.

== Quality Profile

The main goal of coderadar is to make it easy for you to monitor your quality standards.
To be able to focus on the quality metrics that are most important to you and your team,
you can combine a set  metrics within a quality profile. There are several API methods
that take a quality profile as parameter and return information on the metrics that are
part of the quality profile and thus are most important to you.

= Accessing Project and System Data

This section describes the resources you can access to get information about the results of analyses that
were run on a project. These resources are read-only since coderadar creates those resources from the project
configuration you provide.

== Analyzer

coderadar can be configured to use Analyzer plugins that analyze source code to create certain metrics.

=== Listing available Analyzers

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/analyzer/list/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/analyzer/list/http-response.adoc[]

== Metric

The Metric resource describes a metric that an analyzer configured in your project provides.

=== Listing available Metrics

You can list all metrics that have been measured for your project by calling the request below.

[NOTE]
====
Metrics will become available as soon as you have provided an <<creating-analyzing-strategy,Analyzing Strategy>> for your project.
At that moment, analysis of each commit defined in the strategy starts. Depending on how many commits that are,
analysis will take a while.
====

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/metrics/list/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/metrics/list/http-response.adoc[]

== Commit

The Commit resource contains some metadata about a commit to your project's version control system. Commits
will become available as soon as you have created a project and provided valid VCS credentials (see <<creating-a-project,Creating a Project>>).
Depending of the number of commits you have in your project, it may take a while until all commits
are available.

=== Listing a Project's Commits

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/commit/list/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/commit/list/http-response.adoc[]

== Commit Metric Values

You can access the metric values aggregated for each commit using this operation. You have to specify a query object
that defines which metrics you are interested in.

[NOTE]
====
Metric values will become available as soon as you have provided an <<creating-analyzing-strategy,Analyzing Strategy>> for your project.
At that moment, analysis of each commit defined in the strategy starts. Depending on how many commits that are,
analysis will take a while.
