[introduction]
== Introduction

The coderadar server is a tool for continuous source code analysis. This document describes the REST API of the coderadar server.

=== Usage of HTTP Verbs

The following table describes how the coderadar API interprets the HTTP verbs.

.HTTP Verbs
|===
|HTTP Verb | Usage

|GET
|GET is used to retrieve information.

|POST
|POST is used to create and update resources.

|DELETE
|DELETE is used to delete resources.

|PUT
|PUT is not used at this time.

|PATCH
|PATCH is not used at this time.
|===

anchor:usage-of-get[]
[NOTE]
=====
.Usage of GET
If a GET request requires parameters, they can usually be
provided as parameters encoded in the URL. However, in some cases parameters are too unwieldy to
encode them in the URL. In these cases the parameters are expected as JSON string within the request
body. Since some tools don't allow GET requests with a body, coderadar accepts the POST method in
these cases as well.
=====

=== Error Handling

==== Successful Requests

Successful requests return a response with HTTP status 200 (OK) or 201 (CREATED) and contain a JSON structure in the response
body if applicable.

==== Validation Errors

POST requests against the coderadar API usually expect a JSON structure in the request body. If the JSON structure
contains values that are invalid, the API returns a response with HTTP status 400 (bad request) that contains
an error JSON structure object that looks like this:

include::{snippets}/projects/create/error400/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/create/error400/response-fields.adoc[]

==== General Errors

If some unexpected error occurs during the processing of a request, the API returns a response with HTTP status 500
(internal server error).

== User Management
anchor:chapter-configure[]
This section describes the REST endpoints for managing coderadar users.

=== Users
To access the functionality of coderadar you have to register a user.
You need to define a username and a password. The password will be sent as
plain text and hashed on server side for persisting.

==== Loading a User

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/user/get/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/user/get/http-response.adoc[]

==== Login
anchor:login[]
A user has to log in to use other endpoints of coderadar.
If the log in is successful, user obtains two JSON Web Tokens https://jwt.io

* an access token
* a refresh token.

How to use the tokens is described in <<authentication, Authentication>>

===== Login Data Structure

===== Example Request
include::{snippets}/user/auth/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response
include::{snippets}/user/auth/http-response.adoc[]

==== Token Refresh
anchor:refresh[]
To get a new access token after the current token has been expired you have
to use the refresh token you got after successful login

===== Login Data Structure
include::{snippets}/user/refresh/request-fields.adoc[]

===== Example Request
include::{snippets}/user/refresh/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response
include::{snippets}/user/refresh/http-response.adoc[]

anchor:authentication[]

==== Authentication
After a user registered, he or she can start working with coderadar.
The first step is login. To log in in coderadar use the <<login, Login>> endpoint. The user must use the username and the password
specified at registration. If the login was successful user gets two JSON Web Tokens (see https://jwt.io):

* an access token and
* a refresh token.

After that the user has to use the access token for authentication with each request to a protected route or resource.
The tokens are signed by the server so the server can validate the signature of the token to grant the access to resources.
The access token is a Base64 encoded String, that must be added to Authorization HTTP header like this:

 Authorization:eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJjb2RlcmFkYXIiLCJleHAiOjE0ODQ1MTUzOTUsInR5cGUiOiJSRUZSRVNIIiwiaWF0IjoxNDg0NTE1NDU1LCJ1c2VySWQiOiIxIiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJyYWRhciJ9.zfkyc5jkPiAUEt7nU25SJxKprcPiXaiq0Q6bCJ_RrQo

The access token is short-lived and by default expires after 15 minutes.
When the access token expires, the user has to require a new access token. It can be done with the refresh token
user got as response after login. The refresh token must be sent with a request to the <<refresh, Token Refresh>> endpoint.
The refresh token is long-lived and by default expires after 60 days.
When the refresh token expired or was revoked for example after a password change,
a user has to login again to get a new refresh token.

A typical work flow looks like this:

. Client logs in with username and password and gets two tokens
. Client requires resources using the access token in each request
. After 15 minutes client gets a 401-Response
. Clients tries to get a new access token using refresh token
. Clients gets a new acess token and can request further resources
. If the client can't get a new access token using the refresh token, client has to login again with username and password.

== Configuring a Project
anchor:chapter-configure[]

This section describes the resources you can interact with to configure a project to be analyzed by coderadar.
To run an analysis on a project, you have to at least follow these steps:

. <<creating-a-project, Create a Project>> so that coderadar knows where to get the code base. Once this step
  is done, coderadar will clone the repository and create some metadata on the commits and code base. Depending
  on the size of the project, it may take some while to complete.
. <<setting-filepatterns, Define File Patterns>> to tell coderadar which files should be analyzed. If this step
  is omitted, an analysis will provide no results.
. <<create-analyzer, Add at least one analyzer>> to your project. Each added analyzer will run over the
  files specified in the previous step and provide some code metrics.
. <<creating-analyzing-strategy, Add an AnalyzingStrategy>> for your project. Once this is done, coderadar
  will start to analyze all files in the commits defined by the strategy. Depending on the size of the code base
  and the number of configured analyzers, this may take some time to finish.

=== Project

A project defines some metadata about the project you want coderadar to analyze. With a project resource
and its sub-resources you provide coderadar with the information it needs to analyze the source code.

==== Deleting a Project

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/projects/delete/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/projects/delete/http-response.adoc[]

=== Modules
anchor:chapter-modules[]
Source code is usually arranged within multiple modules that each contains a set of source files.
Using the following REST endpoints, you can provide coderadar with information about the modules within
your codebase. Each module simply is a path into the VCS codebase. All files that are within that path
are considered to be part of the module.

Please note that the operations to create, update and delete modules may take some time to be finished since all
files in all commits have to be updated during these operations.

=== File Patterns

A file pattern describes a set of files within a project's code base. Each project can have several file patterns
defined. Each file pattern belongs to a certain file set, the most important of which is the SOURCE file set that
is supposed to contain all source code files of your project.

File patterns may either define a pattern for files to be INCLUDED or files to be EXCLUDED. To compile the list of files
contained in a certain file set (like the SOURCE file set), coderadar will first apply all INCLUDE patterns of that file set and then apply all EXCLUDE
patterns. Thus, the file set will include all INCLUDED files except those that were part of an EXCLUDE pattern.

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/filepatterns/get/http-response.adoc[]

==== Setting a Project's File Patterns
anchor:setting-filepatterns[]

Coderadar views a project's list of file patterns as a single resource. Hence, you can only list and save
all file patterns of a project at once.

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/filepatterns/create-update/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/filepatterns/create-update/http-response.adoc[]

=== Analyzer Configuration

Coderadar has a plugin system for source code analyzers so you can implement your own analyzers that produce the metrics
you need (or you can use the analyzer plugins that are shipped with coderadar). For each project, you can configure each analyzer
plugin via the AnalyzerConfiguration resource.

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfiguration/getSingle/http-response.adoc[]

=== Analyzer Configuration File

An AnalyzerConfiguration can be supplied with a configuration file. For example, the Checkstyle analyzer
can be supplied with a checkstyle configuration xml file to define which rules to check. The content of
the configuration file can be text, xml, or even a binary format, depending on the configuration format
the analyzer needs.

==== Uploading an Analyzer Configuration File

==== Downloading an Analyzer Configuration File

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfigurationFile/download/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/analyzerConfigurationFile/download/http-response.adoc[]

=== Analyzing Strategy

An Analyzing Strategy defines which commits of a project are to be analyzed. If there is no active
Analyzing Strategy present for a project, no analysis will be performed at all. Once you provide
an Analyzing Strategy, analysis jobs will be queued automatically for the commits defined within the strategy.

=== Quality Profile

The main goal of coderadar is to make it easy for you to monitor your quality standards.
To be able to focus on the quality metrics that are most important to you and your team,
you can combine a set  metrics within a quality profile. There are several API methods
that take a quality profile as parameter and return information on the metrics that are
part of the quality profile and thus are most important to you.

== Querying Global Data
anchor:chapter-query-global-data[]

This section describes the resources that are not attached to a project and are thus available server-wide.

=== Analyzer

coderadar can be configured to use Analyzer plugins that analyze source code to create certain metrics.

==== Listing available Analyzers

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/analyzer/list/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/analyzer/list/http-response.adoc[]

== Querying Project Data
anchor:chapter-query-project-data[]

This section describes the resources that are attached to a project and are only available in the context of a
project.

=== Metric

The Metric resource describes a metric that an analyzer configured in your project provides.

==== Listing available Metrics

You can list all metrics that have been measured for your project by calling the request below.

[NOTE]
=====
Metrics will become available as soon as you have provided an <<creating-analyzing-strategy,Analyzing Strategy>> for your project.
At that moment, analysis of each commit defined in the strategy starts. Depending on how many commits that are,
analysis will take a while.
=====

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/metrics/list/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/metrics/list/http-response.adoc[]

=== Commit

The Commit resource contains some metadata about a commit to your project's version control system. Commits
will become available as soon as you have created a project and provided valid VCS credentials (see <<creating-a-project,Creating a Project>>).
Depending of the number of commits you have in your project, it may take a while until all commits
are available.

=== Commit Metric Values

You can access the metric values aggregated for each commit using this operation. You have to specify a query object
that defines which metrics you are interested in.

[NOTE]
=====
Metric values will become available as soon as you have provided an <<creating-analyzing-strategy,Analyzing Strategy>> for your project.
At that moment, analysis of each commit defined in the strategy starts. Depending on how many commits that are,
analysis will take a while.
